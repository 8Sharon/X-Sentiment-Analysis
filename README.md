## 🧠 Introduction
This project focuses on analyzing the sentiment expressed in textual data, classifying it as **Positive**, **Negative**, or **Neutral**. Sentiment analysis is a powerful tool for understanding opinions and emotions in various applications, including:

- Customer feedback analysis
- Social media monitoring
- Market trend analysis

By leveraging machine learning techniques, this project aims to accurately predict sentiment from text samples, providing valuable insights for decision-making.

## ❓ Problem Statement
With the increasing volume of text data generated through platforms like social media, product reviews, and customer service interactions, it becomes challenging to manually analyze public or customer sentiment. Organizations need a scalable and accurate method to understand opinions and emotional tone from large datasets in real-time.

## 🎯 Objective
The primary objective of this project is to build a sentiment classification system using machine learning that can:

- Accurately classify textual data into **Positive**, **Negative**, or **Neutral** sentiment.  
- Handle diverse and unstructured text data efficiently.  
- Provide performance metrics that help in understanding the model’s strengths and weaknesses.  
- Serve as a foundational tool for real-world applications such as social listening, brand analysis, and feedback interpretation.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of text samples paired with their corresponding sentiment labels. The key features of the dataset include:

- **Text**: The raw textual content to be analyzed.
- **Sentiment Labels**: Categorical labels indicating the sentiment, such as:
  - Positive
  - Negative
  - Neutral

The dataset is preprocessed to ensure quality input for model training, which may involve cleaning text (e.g., removing special characters, lowercasing) and handling missing values.

## 🛠️ Model Training
To perform sentiment analysis, the following machine learning model was employed:

- **Random Forest Classifier**: A robust ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees and aggregates their predictions to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.

The training process includes:

1. **Text Preprocessing**:
   - Tokenization
   - Stop-word removal
   - Vectorization (e.g., TF-IDF or word embeddings)
2. **Model Fitting**:
   - The Random Forest Classifier is trained on the labeled dataset, optimizing hyperparameters such as the number of trees and maximum depth.
3. **Cross-Validation**:
   - K-fold cross-validation is used to ensure the model generalizes well to unseen data.

## 📈 Evaluation
The performance of the Random Forest Classifier is evaluated using the **F1-Score**, which balances precision and recall to provide a comprehensive measure of the model's effectiveness. The evaluation process includes:

- **Train-Test Split**: The dataset is divided into training and testing sets to assess the model's performance on unseen data.
- **F1-Score Calculation**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall is computed for each sentiment class (Positive, Negative, Neutral).
- **Confusion Matrix**: A matrix is generated to visualize the model's classification performance across different sentiment labels.
