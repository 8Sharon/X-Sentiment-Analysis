## üß† Introduction
This project focuses on analyzing the sentiment expressed in textual data, classifying it as **Positive**, **Negative**, or **Neutral**. Sentiment analysis is a powerful tool for understanding opinions and emotions in various applications, including:

- Customer feedback analysis
- Social media monitoring
- Market trend analysis

By leveraging machine learning techniques, this project aims to accurately predict sentiment from text samples, providing valuable insights for decision-making.

## üìä Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of text samples paired with their corresponding sentiment labels. The key features of the dataset include:

- **Text**: The raw textual content to be analyzed.
- **Sentiment Labels**: Categorical labels indicating the sentiment, such as:
  - Positive
  - Negative
  - Neutral

The dataset is preprocessed to ensure quality input for model training, which may involve cleaning text (e.g., removing special characters, lowercasing) and handling missing values.

## üõ†Ô∏è Model Training
To perform sentiment analysis, the following machine learning model was employed:

- **Random Forest Classifier**: A robust ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees and aggregates their predictions to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.

The training process includes:

1. **Text Preprocessing**:
   - Tokenization
   - Stop-word removal
   - Vectorization (e.g., TF-IDF or word embeddings)
2. **Model Fitting**:
   - The Random Forest Classifier is trained on the labeled dataset, optimizing hyperparameters such as the number of trees and maximum depth.
3. **Cross-Validation**:
   - K-fold cross-validation is used to ensure the model generalizes well to unseen data.

## üìà Evaluation
The performance of the Random Forest Classifier is evaluated using the **F1-Score**, which balances precision and recall to provide a comprehensive measure of the model's effectiveness. The evaluation process includes:

- **Train-Test Split**: The dataset is divided into training and testing sets to assess the model's performance on unseen data.
- **F1-Score Calculation**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall is computed for each sentiment class (Positive, Negative, Neutral).
- **Confusion Matrix**: A matrix is generated to visualize the model's classification performance across different sentiment labels.
